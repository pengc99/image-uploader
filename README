Yep. Hosts images. One of the more well-coded and graceful scripts 
I’ve written. Takes advantage of the multiple-upload HTML5 element. 
Each uploaded image is hashed to it’s CRC32 hash, and then stored 
in one of 16 directories created via UUID’s. The UUID is generated 
and then a prefix is applied for each element of the hexadecimal 
elements (regex [0-9a-f]). This way, we get a more or less uniform 
distribution of files across 16 directories to reduce the stress 
on the filesystem if you had them all stuffed in one directory. 
Should be good for at least several hundred thousand files per 
instance of the script. The script also tries to be as dynamic and 
self-healing as possible. If it detects missing data directories 
it simply recreates it. If you upload a file that already exists 
it will overwrite the current file. Thumbnails are generated at 
upload using the PHP ImageMagick PECL library. HTML, phpBB, and 
direct URL codes are given when images are uploaded.
